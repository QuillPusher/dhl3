Cling is built on the top of LLVM and Clang libraries. In addition to standard interpreters it has a command line prompt and uses just-in-time (JIT) compiler. This kind of software application is commonly known as an interactive compiler.
Cling started off as a contemporary, high-performance alternative of the current C++ interpreter in the ROOT project - CINT.
